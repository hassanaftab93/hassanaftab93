# Welcome to My Github Profile ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

Hi, My Name is Hassan Aftab. I have done my Computer Science Bachelors in 2018. Now, my area of expertise is Data Science.

I am a IBM Certified Data Scientist. I have done some Projects on my own to Polish my Data Analysis Skills.

## Bachelors Thesis

### Ultrasonic Object Detection for the Blind

The system is designed for visually impaired people. It is an Arduino-based system integrated on a white cane (walking stick for the blind) that uses Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

If an obstacle is detected in the userâ€™s range, the cane would tell the user in the form of diï¬€erent beeps and alarms. At this point, we are assuming that the user is not hearing impaired so that he or she can detect the alarm sounds. 

Apart from an Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, the system also has a GPS module to track the location of the user. This location can be checked by the userâ€™s relative using mobile SMS service.

The module is capable of sending an SMS message to the family member periodically / on button press, that contains the google maps location of the device (and the person using it).

## Data Science Projects

### Web Scraping & Analysis of Stocks with Python
Feb 2021 â€“ Mar 2021

Extraction of financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I visualized it to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with were:

<li>Tesla</li>
<li>Amazon</li>
<li>AMD</li>
<li>GameStop</li>

### Data Analysis of House Sales in Kings County, USA
Mar 2021

Tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features.
Analysis and prediction of housing prices using attributes or features such as:

<li>Square Footage</li>
<li>Number of bedrooms</li>
<li>Number of floors</li>

and so on

### Loan Payment Prediction Model
May 2021

Loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data. Used the following models to decide the best among them for this scenario:

<li>k-Nearest Neighbour</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>

<br>
The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
<br/>
<br/>

<li>Jaccard index</li>
<li>F1-score</li>
<li>Log Loss</li>
<br>

### Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto
June 2021

I was required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postal code and borough information.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information needed to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. I was required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas data frame so that it was in a structured format.

Once the data was in a structured format, I used the dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto, with the help of Foursquare API and K-means Clustering Algorithm for Unsupervised Machine Learning.
